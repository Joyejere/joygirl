	<h2>Why We Exist</h2>
	<p>Every child has a right to learn and get a good quality education, regardless of gender, where they live or their circumstances. There are 30 rights contained in the universal declaration of Human Rights created in 1948 by the United Nations. They are called Human Rights because they are universal and applies to everyone.Article 26. Universal Declaration of Human Right states that "Everyone has the right to education."</p>
	<p>
		 Female education is crucial for national development. The general belief is that “when you educate a man, you educate one but when you educate a woman, you educate a nation.” This is so because the education of every child starts from the family and the mother is the first teacher. Educating the girl child produces mothers who are educated and who will in turn educate their children, care for their families and help provide for their children. Without proper education, the girl child cannot make informed decisions about her future, her career and her goals.
